# Enigma Machine Project
This project is intended to create an Enigma Machine emulator that will interface with an Arduino to show in real time, stroke by stroke the output of an Enigma machine.
Right now, the Project is in its first stage, in which I will create a pure logical emulator, starting with a Python version.

This Python version works properly as of this version, however it is to be noted that a letter switchboard has still not been implemented.

This code will probably be moved to dart and into a flutter application before the Arduino port.
